# simple-nft-auction

The app is only working on Ropsten and was made for testing the auction smart contract.

## Notes

- The app is written in TypeScript.
- The app uses `ethers@5.0.0-beta.175`, which is [recommended](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/tree/ethers-v5-beta#the-ethers-project) for use with new projects, but has limited documentation.
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Learn more in [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
